Question 2: Explore and list core technologies used in Web Engineering, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and explain the role of each.
Ans: 
1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the content and structure of a website by using tags and elements. HTML tells the browser what content to display, such as text, images, links, and forms.
Role in Web Engineering:
•	Creates the basic structure of web pages
•	Defines headings, paragraphs, tables, forms, and multimedia
•	Uses semantic elements to improve accessibility and SEO
Example:
A webpage’s layout with a header, navigation bar, main content, and footer is created using HTML.
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to control the visual appearance of a web page. It works alongside HTML by applying styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts. CSS ensures that websites look attractive and consistent across different devices.
Role in Web Engineering:
•	Styles text, images, and backgrounds
•	Controls layout using Flexbox and Grid
•	Makes websites responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
•	Adds animations and visual effects
Example:
Using CSS to change font colors, align elements, and design a responsive layout.

3. JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables interactivity and dynamic behavior on web pages. It runs in the user’s browser and allows websites to respond to user actions without reloading the page.
Role in Web Engineering:
•	Handles user events like clicks and keystrokes
•	Validates forms on the client side
•	Updates content dynamically (e.g., live search results)
•	Communicates with servers using AJAX
Example:
Showing an alert message when a button is clicked or validating a form before submission.
4. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)
PHP is a server-side scripting language used to build dynamic websites. It runs on the server and processes data before sending the final HTML output to the browser.
Role in Web Engineering:
•	Processes form submissions
•	Connects to and manages databases
•	Handles user authentication and sessions
•	Generates dynamic web content
Example:
Processing a login form and retrieving user data from a database.

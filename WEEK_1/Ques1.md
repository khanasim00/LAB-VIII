Question 1: In your own words, explain Web Engineering.
Ans: Web Engineering is the systematic application of software engineering principles to the design, development, deployment, and maintenance of web applications.
It treats web systems as full-scale software products rather than simple web pages. Web Engineering focuses on understanding user requirements, designing efficient architectures, developing reliable code, testing for quality, and maintaining applications over time. It also emphasizes usability, accessibility, security, scalability, and performance, since web applications are highly interactive and used by large numbers of users.
In short, Web Engineering ensures that web applications are built in a structured, reliable, and professional manner, making them easy to use, secure, and maintainable in a rapidly changing web environment
The Web Engineering Process (Lifecycle) describes the structured stages followed to develop and maintain a web application efficiently. It typically includes the following phases:
1.	Requirements Analysis
Identifies user needs, system functions, and non-functional requirements such as performance, security, and usability.
2.	Design
Defines the system architecture, database structure, navigation flow, user interface, and content layout.
3.	Development (Implementation)
Involves coding the front end and back end, integrating databases, APIs, and other services.
4.	Testing
Ensures the application works correctly through functional, usability, performance, security, and compatibility testing.
5.	Deployment
Releases the web application to a live environment with proper server configuration and security settings.
6.	Maintenance and Evolution
Includes fixing bugs, updating content, improving performance, adding new features, and handling security updates.
